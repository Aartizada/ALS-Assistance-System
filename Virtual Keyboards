#Keyboards
While Windows 10 comes standard with a virtual keyboard, it proved to be tiring and cumbersome to use when paired with a facial tracking mouse.
To remedy this, we started searching for alternatives. Most alternatives are remakes of the standard keyboard, and are honestly not better than the Windows 10 keyboard.

One software stood out, with a fully customizable keyboard. Including the ability to run scripts using buttons on the board.
It is a paid software, but for $30... About the price of a keyboard. We didn't care.
