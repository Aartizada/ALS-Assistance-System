# ALS-Assistance-System

The point of this Repository is to document the software and workarounds that I have implimented in my attempt at helping a man with ALS.


## Back Story
I was asked by a man with ALS to help him use a computer. He is unable to move his body for the most part, and only has control over his head and neck. Similar assistive solutions can be thousands of euros, and thus was not an option. I am creating this repository to document the software I used and the things I developed to assist him, in hopes that it helps others in similar situations. 

## Hardware
- Computer was a basic LENOVO IdeaCentre 310S-08ASR (90G900A2GE) connected to a 60" Samsung televeision. 
- SANDBERG USB Webcam Pro+ 4K
- Anker Power Conf bluetooth conference speaker.
