# ALS-Assistance-System

The point of this Repository is to document the software and workarounds that I have implimented in my attempt at helping a man with ALS.

### Back Story
I was asked by a man with ALS to help him use a computer. He is unable to move his body for the most part, and only has control over his head and neck. Similar assistive solutions can be thousands of euros, and thus was not an option. I am creating this repository to document the software I used and the things I developed to assist him, in hopes that it helps others in similar situations. 

### Hardware
- Computer was a basic LENOVO IdeaCentre 310S-08ASR (90G900A2GE) connected to a 60" Samsung televeision. 
- SANDBERG USB Webcam Pro+ 4K

# Mouse Tracking

We tried a variety of mouth-tracking, eye gaze and facial movement tracking softwares with varying results. Some didn't work well with the distance we were using. Naturally, we didn't want to sit him a half meter away from a big screen tv. We also didn't want a large obtrusive arm reaching out to put the camera on his face.

### The best open source software in our use-case was

# Keyboards
While Windows 10 comes standard with a virtual keyboard, it proved to be tiring and cumbersome to use when paired with a facial tracking mouse.
To remedy this, we started searching for alternatives. Most alternatives are remakes of the standard keyboard, and are honestly not better than the Windows 10 keyboard.

One software stood out, with a fully customizable keyboard. Including the ability to run scripts using buttons on the board.
It is a paid software, but for $30... About the price of a keyboard. We didn't care.
